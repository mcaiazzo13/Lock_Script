# Lock_Script
I made this simple script using i3lock.
Takes a screenshot, modify it (with convert) then call i3lock using that image and in the end remove images.
Personally i use an alias so i can use this script anytime i want.
In the next step i'll try making a random modification.

You need :
1. scrot
2. i3lock
3. imageMagick (convert)
